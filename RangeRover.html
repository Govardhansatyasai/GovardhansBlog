            <h1>Range Rover Autobiography</h1>
            <p>The Land Rover Range Rover, generally shortened to Range Rover, is a 4x4 luxury SUV produced by Land Rover, a marque and sub-brand of Jaguar Land Rover. The Range Rover line was launched in 1970 by British Leyland and is now in its fifth generation.

                Additional models have been launched under the Range Rover name, including the Range Rover Sport, Range Rover Evoque, and Range Rover Velar.</p>
            <p>On 26 November 2004, Land Rover released the first photographs of the Range Rover Sport, a new model it planned to show to the public for the first time at the 2004 North American International Auto Show. The Range Rover Sport is a production car development of the Range Stormer concept vehicle the company showcased in the 2004 North American International Auto Show. Though called the Range Rover Sport "L320", it was not merely a new specification within the Range Rover line-up, but rather an adapted Discovery "L319", or T5 Platform Discovery/LR3 with Range Rover exterior styling and Range Rover interior seating and dash forms, a shortened wheelbase, smaller luggage capacity and a single rather than split tailgate which was angled back for styling improvements. With entry model pricing close to upper Discovery models, the Sport became the biggest seller of all the Land Rover products. This model was released for sale in late 2004 as a 2004 model.</p>
                <p><h3>Price</h3>

            <p>Land Rover Range Rover price ranges between Rs. 2.39 Crore - Rs. 4.17 Crore depending on the variant selected.</p>
                
                <h3>When was the Range Rover launched?</h3>
                
               <p>The Range Rover was launched in India on 12 January, 2022.</p> 
                
                <h3>variants does the Range Rover get?</h3> 
                
                <p>The Range Rover is available in four variants - SE, HSE, Autobiography, and First Edition trims.</p>
                
                <h3>What are the features available in the Range Rover?</h3>
                
                <h4>Exterior:</h4>
                
                <p>The new Range Rover continues to carry some of its key signature elements like the familiar daytime running lights, subtly swept-up waistline, slightly slanted roofline, and an unmistakable silhouette. Nevertheless, the most radical change comes at the back – here Land Rover has given it an elongated dark panel that houses neatly concealed vertical rear lights and horizontally positioned dynamic turn signals. </p>
                
                <h4>Interior:</h4>
                
                <p>The swanky-looking SUV carries its aesthetics from the outside to its interior. It’s a tech fest with the biggest display screens and a new two-spoke steering wheel. A new 13.1-inch curved infotainment touchscreen partly sticks out of the dashboard, while the digital instrument cluster comes with a 13.7-inch high-definition screen. Meanwhile, the infotainment system now gets a built-in Alexa voice assistant.</p>
                
                <h3>What are the engine, performance, and specifications of the Range Rover?</h3>
                
                <p>The Range Rover comes with three powertrain options. The 3.0-litre, six-cylinder, turbocharged petrol and diesel engines are integrated with a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. The petrol unit makes 394bhp and 550Nm, while the diesel produces 346bhp and 700Nm. On the other hand, a 4.4-litre, twin-turbocharged, V8 mill generates 523bhp and 750Nm.</p>
