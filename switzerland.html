            <h1>Switzerland</h1>
            <p>Switzerland is a landlocked country in Central Europe. Neighboring countries include Austria, France, Italy, Liechtenstein, and Germany. The geography of Switzerland is mostly mountains (Alps in the south, Jura in the northwest) with a central plateau of rolling hills, plains, and large lakes. The government system is formally a confederation but similar in structure to a federal republic; the president is the chief of state and head of government. Switzerland has a modern market economy in which the prices of goods and services are determined in a free price system. Switzerland is a member of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).</p>
            <h3>Culture</h3>
            <p>Folk art is kept alive in organizations all over the country. In Switzerland, it is mostly expressed in music, dance, poetry, wood carving and embroidery. There are also many regional and local rites demarcating times of the year. Yodeling, despite being stereotypical for Switzerland, is not widespread and is limited to only some mountain areas. The same is true for the accordion, which is sometimes called by the name Schwiizer√∂rgeli, implying that it was a Swiss musical instrument, rather than the German Handorgel.</p>
            <h3>Climate</h3>
            <p>The Swiss climate is generally temperate, but can vary greatly across localities, from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the near-Mediterranean climate at Switzerland's southern tip. Some valley areas in the southern part of Switzerland offer cold-hardy palm trees. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall, ideal for pastures/grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains may see weeks-long intervals of stable conditions. At the same time, the lower lands tend to suffer from inversion during such periods, hiding the sun.</p>
            <h3>Environment</h3>
            <p>Switzerland's many small valleys separated by high mountains often host unique ecologies. The mountainous regions themselves offer a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes. The climatic, geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change. According to the 2014 Environmental Performance Index, Switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment, due to its high scores on environmental public health, its heavy reliance on renewable sources of energy (hydropower and geothermal energy), and its level of greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020 it was ranked third out of 180 countries. The country pledged to cut GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 compared to the level of 1990 and plans to reach zero emissions by 2050.</p>
